# comfyui_stealth_pnginfo

Fork of [sd_webui_stealth_pnginfo](https://github.com/ashen-sensored/sd_webui_stealth_pnginfo) with [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) support.

This adds a custom node `Save Image (Stealth)` to write images with stealth metadata, and hooks into the frontend to allow drag-dropping images with stealth metadata embedded to load their workflow.

Original README follows below.

~~# sd_webui_stealth_pnginfo
This extension is for bypassing Discord exif data stripping
Only works for png image, does not work for jpg image. 
Extension is auto activated, functioning on top of WebUI PNG Info, no additional setup is required after installation.~~

~~Injected PNG Info data is only available for webui PNG info, external exif data viewer will still show nothing.~~

Discord is no longer stripping Metadata, archiving this repo.
